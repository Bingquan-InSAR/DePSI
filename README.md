# DePSI

DePSI (van Leijen, 2014) is an open source software for processing Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PS-InSAR) data, originally implemented in MATLAB. From 2024, TUDelft and Netherlands eScience Center are collaborating to develop a Python version of DePSI, with recent advances in PS-InSAR.
